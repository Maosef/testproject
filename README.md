# Synopsis
A basic LaTeX parser which reverses the case of LaTeX text without altering its formatting.
For example, the mCase changes all uppercase M's to a lowercase m and vice versa. The second (unfinished) program should reverse the case of every letter.

To use this program, download/clone the project, then import it with Eclipse or another Java IDE. Naming the .tex file (default is KLSadd) and running the program will create a new .txt file, which can be viewed online with ShareLaTeX.
# Motivation
Created as a response to a test, part of application for the NIST DRMF.
